    <h1>What I learnt in 6 months of Personal Training.</h1>
    <p>So, in the month of july of the year 2021 my height was almost 6ft and my <br>
       weight was <strong>114 kgs</strong>.I was in the obese category and was feeling very <br>
       demotivated but, then I thought to join gym with my brother who was <br>
       already at a gym. So, I took up personal training and started my journey <br>
       of gymming and fitness.</p> <hr>
       <h3>  Progress till now</h3>
       <p>At start I was unable to bench blank rod of 20 kgs so my trainer had to <br>
       specially put the smaller rod of 10 kgs which barely fit in bench press machine <br>
     for me. I was unable to dead 50kgs and I started with body weight squats only.</p>
